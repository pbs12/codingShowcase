%% NOTES
% For our code to reliably work, each the image dimensions must be
% multiples of 8 (e.g. the image must be in one of the standard image 
% aspect ratios, such as 640x480, 1080x720, 1920x1080, etc.). The image can
% be RGB (w/ 3 channels) or grayscale (1 channel).

% In addition, our implementation is not as efficient as real JPEG
% compressors, and as such its runtime scales largely with
% the area of the image. Here, we run tests on images of smaller sizes,
% which are included in this directory, but it may still take a few minutes
% for the code to run. 

% 'quant.csv' must be in the same directory as this code for it to work. 
% The quantization matrix is kept separate for easy access and editing.

%% MAIN FUNCTIONS (helper methods in following section)

%compress()
%Takes in an image filename, splits the image into its R,G,B components if they are there,
%then iterates over 8x8 blocks in the image to perform the 2D Discrete 
%Cosine Transform on them, followed by quantization using the 8x8 
%quantization matrix stored in the same directory (quant_matrix_filename).
%This produces a sparse matrix of the DCT transform coefficiencts, 
%which is then transcribed to ouput files using run-length encoding.

%Outputs proportion of numbers needed to be stored from original image to
%with run-length encoding. For example, if original raw image is 256x256x3,
%and the number of pairs stored is 9000, that's 18000 numbers stored vs.
%196608, the compression factor would be ~.09,a ~90% reduction 
%in numbers that need to be stored --

%quantize()
%Takes in M, a 8x8 block of DCT cosine coefficients, and conducts element-wise
